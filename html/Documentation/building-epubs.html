<h1>Building ePubs</h1>

<p>Manually building:</p>

<pre><code>python -m templates.simple "Hello World" "My Other Book"
python -m epub.zipping "Hello World" "My Other Book"</code></pre>

<p>There is also a GitHub Workflow <code>Create Release ePubs</code> found in <code>create-release-epubs.yml</code> which will automatically build ePubs when unzipped files are uploaded to <code>epub/</code>.</p>
