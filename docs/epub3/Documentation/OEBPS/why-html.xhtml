<p>Markdown was also considered (easier to write and more human readable), however HTML has many advantages over Markdown:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Different flavors of Markdown make it an inconsistent format to store documents in.</li>
    <li>Certain tags in HTML have no equivalent in Markdown (for instance <code>ruby</code>).</li>
    <li>No equivalent for MathML in Markdown.</li>
    <li>HTML is a more widespread file format; practically every smartphone, tablet, laptop, desktop, etc has a web browser.</li>
    <li>HTML has better compatibility with ePub.</li>
</ul></body></html>
