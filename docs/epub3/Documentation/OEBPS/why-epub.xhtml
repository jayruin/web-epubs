<p>PDF was also considered, however ePub has many advantages over PDF:</p>

<ul>
    <li>ePub has support for reflowable documents. This means it can adapt to any screen size. Of course, ePub also has support for fixed-layout documents.</li>
    <li>
        High compatibility with HTML and web standards in general.
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">W3C maintains the CSS standard</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/7753">W3C and WHATWG agreed to collaborate on a single version of HTML</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/01/pressrelease-idpf-w3c-combination.html.en">IDPF who were maintaining the ePub standard have merged with W3C</a></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The XHTML files of ePubs can be deployed on the web (Github Pages) without any modification.</li>
    <li>Widespread support for ePub including ereaders, smartphones, tablets, laptops, desktops, etc. PDF is practically unreadable on smaller devices. Try reading a PDF on a 6 inch ereader!</li>
    <li>ePub converts to PDF fairly well, but the reverse is not true.</li>
</ul></body></html>
